Description: We develop a new ensemble method for combining multiple clustering outcomes.
    The method is agnostic about the source of the clusterings and is not tied to any
    clustering method such as k-means. The ensemble method, TREC, or tree reduced ensemble
    clustering produces a single cluster tree as its output.
